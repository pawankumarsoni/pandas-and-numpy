# pandas-and-numpy

Pandas has two main data structures — 
Series which is one dimensional and DataFrame which is two dimensional. In this part we’ll look at Series and then build on that to understand DataFrame in the next one.The Series just takes the dictionary and sets the keys as the index and values as the corresponding data points. It is quite similar to NumPy in that we can access the data points using integer indices.A DataFrame arranges data in rows and columns in a tabular structure.The point here is to demonstrate that DataFrame is nothing but a bunch of Series bound together by common indices.
